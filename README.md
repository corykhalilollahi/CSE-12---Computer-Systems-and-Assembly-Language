# CSE-12---Computer-Systems-and-Assembly-Language
Large lab projects that I worked on in CSE 12: Computer Systems and Assembly Language

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository contains all of the lab projects that I worked on in CSE 12: Computer Systems and Assembly Language during my second
quarter at UC Santa Cruz. Each Lab folder in this repository contains the project itself (either programmed in MML or MARS), as well as a
README file explaining the contents of the particular program and how to run it. The Lab4 folder also contains some "test" text files that
are needed to run the program. Labs 1 and 2 were done using MML, and all of the logic circuits were created completely from scratch. Labs 
3-5 were done using MARS, which is a simulator that allows users to create programs in a MIPS environment. The assembly code found in these
labs were also created completely from scratch (no base code from the professor), with the exception of some premade function names in 
Lab 5. Each lab was challenging and thought-provoking, and they focused on lower abstraction programming topics such as data storage, 
binary, logic gates, and memory.
